// Static facts about a syntax node — the value of a literal, the interned name
// of an identifier — do not change between evaluations, but a node inside a
// function body is evaluated once per call. This file caches them.
//
// The cache is a flat array keyed by the node's dense ID, so a lookup is one
// bounds check and an index, with no hashing and no indirection. The parser
// says how many nodes it made, so the array is the right size from the start;
// it was pages of a sparse array before, and reaching through the page table
// was 11% of the evaluator on a call-heavy workload.

// static is what is known about a node without evaluating it in a scope.
