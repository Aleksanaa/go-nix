// Working out where every name comes from, before anything is evaluated.
//
// Which binding a name refers to is decided entirely by the syntax around it:
// `x` in `let x = 1; in f x` is the `x` two constructs out, in the first slot
// that construct binds, however often the expression is evaluated and whatever
// the values turn out to be. So it is settled once, here, and an evaluation
// reads the answer instead of searching for it.
//
// What that replaces is a search of the scope chain per name, with a per-worker
// memo in front of it to make the second search cheap. The memo could only ever
// be a guess checked at run time, because the slot it named was a position in a
// set built while evaluating; and it was written while evaluating, which is
// what made borrowing a binding cost a forced `with` set and a poisoned memo.
// None of that survives a resolved name: the frame is counted out and the slot
// is indexed.
//
// `with` is the one thing the syntax cannot settle, since what a set holds is
// not known until it is evaluated. A name no construct binds is looked for in
// the nearest enclosing `with` at run time, and in the ones outside it after
// that; a name with no `with` anywhere around it is undefined, and saying so
// is the resolver's job rather than the evaluator's — which is why a typo in a
// branch that is never taken is still an error, here as in Nix.

// provide, or none at all.
