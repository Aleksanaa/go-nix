# Forcing every value of a wide attribute set: the shape a package's dependency
# closure has, where forcing one derivation forces all of its inputs.
#
# `deepSeq` forces the whole set, and `listToAttrs` builds it so that every
# value is a thunk until then. The values are strict folds so they are real
# work, not already-evaluated constants.

#   gon eval -f examples/set-force.nix

# `n` is on its own line so that examples/bench.sh can rewrite it.
