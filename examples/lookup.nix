# Variable resolution: every iteration below resolves names ten scopes up, and
# two more through a `with`, which both evaluators have to search dynamically.
#
# Nix resolves lexical names to a position at parse time and indexes straight
# into the environment; gon walks a chain of scopes. This is the workload that
# tells the two apart.
#
# `n` is on its own line so that examples/bench.sh can rewrite it.
